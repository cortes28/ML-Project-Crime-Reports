 Machine learning allows for a system to learn and improve
as time goes by when trained with an increasing amount of
patterns and data. This would be a useful tool in creating a
system that would help society be aware of the crime rate.
There are numerous crimes that can occur any day at any time;
making it near impossible to prevent every single crime from
occurring. Rather than strive for the impossible, the algorithm
we are suggesting will be able to pinpoint the possibility of
a crime being violent or not, allowing for citizens to be more
aware of the risks. The City of Los Angeles has a violent
crime rate of 445 crimes per 100,000 people, higher than the
national rate in 2020.  We will analyze the data using multiple models such as KNN to examine the data to view the outcome if based on given information such as time,location (latitude & longtitude), age, ect. to determine if the given crime report was a violent crime or not. 

The dataset was retreived from https://data.lacity.org/Public-Safety/Crime-Data-from-2020-to-Present/2nrs-mtv8 and it is provided by the Los Angeles Police Department. It is too large to be provided directly from GitHub. The dataset was retreived in late winter 2023, it is updated frequently as well. 

There is a processed dataset as well if visualization of the processed dataset is needed or easier access is needed.
